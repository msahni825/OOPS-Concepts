Polymorphism means one name, many forms. Polymorphism manifests itself by having multiple methods all with the same name, but slightly different functionality.

There are 2 basic types of polymorphism. Overridding, also called run-time polymorphism. For method overloading, the compiler determines which method will be executed, 
and this decision is made when the code gets compiled. 

Overloading which is referred to as compile-time polymorphism. Method will be used for method overriding is determined at runtime based on the dynamic type of an object.
