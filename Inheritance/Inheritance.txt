Inheritance is a way to reuse code of existing objects, or to establish a subtype from an existing object, or both, depending upon programming language support. 

In classical inheritance where objects are defined by classes, classes can inherit attributes and behavior from pre-existing classes called base classes, superclasses, 
parent classes or ancestor classes. The resulting classes are known as derived classes, subclasses or child classes. The relationships of classes through inheritance 
gives rise to a hierarchy.
The properties commonly include class data variables, properties, and methods or functions. The superclass establishes a common interface and foundational functionality, 
which specialized subclasses can inherit, modify, and supplement.

The software inherited by a subclass is considered reused in the subclass. In some cases, a subclass may customize or redefine a method inherited from the superclass. 
A superclass method which can be redefined in this way is called a virtual method.
