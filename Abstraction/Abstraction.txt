Data abstraction and encapuslation are closely tied together, because a simple definition of data abstraction is the development of classes, objects, types in
terms of their interfaces and functionality, instead of their implementation details.

Abstraction denotes a model, a view, or some other focused representation for an actual item.

An abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds of object and thus provide crisply defined conceptual boundaries, 
relative to the perspective of the viewer.‚Äù

Data abstraction is nothing more than the implementation of an object that contains the same essential properties & actions we can find in the original object we are representing.
